This is the frontend for the [Frontend Project](https://ahmedjaderfullstack-todoapp.netlify.app). 

- This is a MERN Full Stack Web App designed for simply adding, updating, removing your objectives
- This is a two part repository having the Front-End hosted on Netlify, and the Back-End hosted on Render
- This is a project I learned to make to teach me more on Full-Stack Development
